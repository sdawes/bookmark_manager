# Bookmark Manager

Week 4 Makers Academy project: a bookmark manager. Utilising the following aspects of web development:

* Relational databases
* Security considerations
* More feature testing with Capybara

We are going to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. A bookmark manager is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.
